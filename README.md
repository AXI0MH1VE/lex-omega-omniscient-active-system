[![Constitution](https://img.shields.io/badge/Constitution-Read-blue)](https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE/CDA-Constitution)

This project operates under the **[Constitution of a Deterministic Assistant (CDA-v1.0)](https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE/CDA-Constitution)**, establishing transparent operational boundaries for AI systems.

**Core Principles:**
- 🔍 **Transparency**: Glass Box Mandate - All operations are auditable
- ⚙️ **Determinism**: Predictable Tool Mandate - No autonomous agency
- 🤝 **Subservience**: Tool-in-Hand Mandate - Human authority paramount
